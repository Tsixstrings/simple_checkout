# Checkout App

This is a simple checkout App with React js. The data state is stored with Redux (checkout and catalog data). In production the application should persist this data in another way (now the store is reset when the page reload).

To run the app just type the following command and the server will run in http://localhost:3000
```
npm start
```

By default, the catalog has 3 products, but you can update your catalog by clicking the gear button (in the top).

To upload the catalog, the data structure must be respected. This is an array of objects like this
```
[...
{
    "sku": number,
    "icon": string(fontawesome icon name),
    "name": string,
    "price": number,
    "promo": string
}
...
]
```

You can also specify the 2 promos in the updated products just typing this 2 codes in the "promo" property.

```
"2x1" ==> 2 for 1 promo
"bulk>3": ==> Bulk discount (-1â‚¬ in each item if quantity is >= 3)
```

The App also have 2 end-2-end tests using the cypress library.
To run the tests just run the app and then execute the following command
```
npm run cypress open
```
This tests the correct use of both promotions.
